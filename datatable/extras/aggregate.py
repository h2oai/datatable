    Aggregate datatable in-place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_bins: int
        Number of bins for 1D aggregation.
    nx_bins: int
        Number of x bins for 2D aggregation.
    ny_bins: int
        Number of y bins for 2D aggregation.
    max_dimensions: int
        Number of columns at which start using the projection method.
    seed: int
        Seed to be used for the projection method.
    
    Returns
    -------
    The target datatable is aggregated in-place and gets an additional column `count` 
    with the number of members for each exemplar. The function returns
    a new one-column datatable that contains exemplar_ids for each of the original rows.
