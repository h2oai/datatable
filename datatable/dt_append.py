def _rbind(self, *frames, force=False, bynames=True):
    """
    Append rows of `frames` to the current Frame.

    This is equivalent to `list.extend()` in Python: the Frames are combined
    by rows, i.e. rbinding a Frame of shape [n x k] to a Frame of shape
    [m x k] produces a Frame of shape [(m + n) x k].

    This method modifies the current Frame in-place. If you do not want
    the current Frame modified, then append all Frames to an empty Frame:
    `dt.Frame().rbind(frame1, frame2)`.

    If Frame(s) being appended have columns of types different from the
    current Frame, then these columns will be promoted to the largest of two
    types: bool -> int -> float -> string.

    If you need to append multiple Frames, then it is more efficient to
    collect them into an array first and then do a single `rbind()`, than it is
    to append them one-by-one.

    Appending data to a Frame opened from disk will force loading the
    current Frame into memory, which may fail with an OutOfMemory exception.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frames: sequence or list of Frames
        One or more Frame to append. These Frames should have the same
        columnar structure as the current Frame (unless option `force` is
        used).

    force: boolean, default False
        If True, then the Frames are allowed to have mismatching set of
        columns. Any gaps in the data will be filled with NAs.

    bynames: boolean, default True
        If True, the columns in Frames are matched by their names. For
        example, if one Frame has columns ["colA", "colB", "colC"] and the
        other ["colB", "colA", "colC"] then we will swap the order of the first
        two columns of the appended Frame before performing the append.
        However if `bynames` is False, then the column names will be ignored,
        and the columns will be matched according to their order, i.e. i-th
        column in the current Frame to the i-th column in each appended
        Frame.
