@typed(dts=DataTable_t, force=bool, bynames=bool, inplace=bool)
def append(self, *dts, force=False, bynames=True, inplace=True):
    """
    Append rows of datatables `dts` to the current datatable.

    This is equivalent to `rbind()` in R: the datatables are combined by rows,
    i.e. appending a datatable of shape [n x k] to a datatable of shape [m x k]
    produces a datatable of shape [(m + n) x k].

    By default, the source datatable is modified in-place. If you do not want
    the original datatable modified, use option `inplace=False`.

    If datatable(s) being appended have columns of different types than the
    source datatable, then such column will be promoted to the "largest" of two
    types: bool -> int -> decimal -> float -> string -> categorical.

    If you need to append multiple datatables, then it is more efficient to
    collect them into an array first and then do a single `append()`, than it is
    to append them one-by-one.

    Appending data to a datatable opened from disk will force loading the
    source datatable into memory, which may fail with an OutOfMemory exception.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dts: sequence or list of DataTables
        One or more datatable to append. These datatables should have the same
        columnar structure as the current datatable (unless option `force` is
        used).

    force: boolean, default False
        If True, then the datatables are allowed to have mismatching set of
        columns. Any gaps in the data will be filled with NAs.

    bynames: boolean, default True
        If True, the columns in datatables are matched by their names. For
        example, if one datatable has columns ["colA", "colB", "colC"] and the
        other ["colB", "colA", "colC"] then we will swap the order of the first
        two columns of the appended datatable before performing the append.
        However if `bynames` is False, then the column names will be ignored,
        and the columns will be matched according to their order, i.e. i-th
        column in the current datatable to the i-th column in each appended
        datatable.

    inplace: boolean, default True
        If True, then the data is appended to the current datatable modifying
        it in-place. If False, then the current datatable remains unchanged
        and a copy datatable is created and returned instead.
