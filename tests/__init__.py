def same_iterables(a, b):
    """
    Convenience function for testing datatables created from dictionaries.

    On Python3.6+ it simply checks whether `a == b`. However on Python3.5, it
    checks whether `a` and `b` have same elements but potentially in a different
    order.

    The reason for this helper function is the difference between semantics of
    a dictionary in Python3.6 versus older versions: in Python3.6 dictionaries
    preserved the order of their keys, whereas in previous Python versions they
    didn't. Thus, if one creates say a datatable

        dt = datatable.Frame({"A": 1, "B": "foo", "C": 3.5})

    then in Python3.6 it will be guaranteed to have columns ("A", "B", "C") --
    in this order, whereas in Python3.5 or older the order may be arbitrary.
    Thus, this function is designed to help with testing of such a datatable:

        assert same_iterables(dt.names, ("A", "B", "C"))
        assert same_iterables(dt.types, ("int", "string", "float"))

    Then in Python3.6 lhs and rhs will be tested with strict equality, whereas
    in older Python versions the test will be weaker, taking into account the
    non-deterministic nature of the dictionary that created the datatable.
