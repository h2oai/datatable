.. teaser-begin

``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder <https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html>`_ methods).

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. teaser-end

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import attr

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class SomeClass(object):
   ...     a_number = attr.ib(default=42)
   ...     list_of_numbers = attr.ib(factory=list)
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> attr.asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a complete set of comparison methods (equality and ordering),
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

On Python 3.6 and later, you can often even drop the calls to ``attr.ib()`` by using `type annotations <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/types.html>`_.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing ``tuple``\ s or `confusingly behaving <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#namedtuples>`_ ``namedtuple``\ s.
Which in turn encourages you to write *small classes* that do `one thing well <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries>`_.
Never again violate the `single responsibility principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_ just because implementing ``__init__`` et al is a painful drag.

``attrs`` is released under the `MIT <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>`_ license,
its documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://www.attrs.org/>`_,
the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs>`_,
and the latest release on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/attrs/>`_.
It’s rigorously tested on Python 2.7, 3.5+, and PyPy.

We collect information on **third-party extensions** in our `wiki <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/wiki/Extensions-to-attrs>`_.
Feel free to browse and add your own!

If you'd like to contribute to ``attrs`` you're most welcome and we've written `a little guide <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ to get you started!

Release Information
===================

20.3.0 (2020-11-05)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``attr.define()``, ``attr.frozen()``, ``attr.mutable()``, and ``attr.field()`` remain **provisional**.

  This release does **not** change change anything about them and they are already used widely in production though.

  If you wish to use them together with mypy, you can simply drop `this plugin <https://gist.github.com/hynek/1e3844d0c99e479e716169034b5fa963#file-attrs_ng_plugin-py>`_ into your project.

  Feel free to provide feedback to them in the linked issue #668.

  We will release the ``attrs`` namespace once we have the feeling that the APIs have properly settled.
  `#668 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/668>`_


Changes
^^^^^^^

- ``attr.s()`` now has a *field_transformer* hook that is called for all ``Attribute``\ s and returns a (modified or updated) list of ``Attribute`` instances.
  ``attr.asdict()`` has a *value_serializer* hook that can change the way values are converted.
  Both hooks are meant to help with data (de-)serialization workflows.
  `#653 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/653>`_
- ``kw_only=True`` now works on Python 2.
  `#700 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/700>`_
- ``raise from`` now works on frozen classes on PyPy.
  `#703 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/703>`_,
  `#712 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/712>`_
- ``attr.asdict()`` and ``attr.astuple()`` now treat ``frozenset``\ s like ``set``\ s with regards to the *retain_collection_types* argument.
  `#704 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/704>`_
- The type stubs for ``attr.s()`` and ``attr.make_class()`` are not missing the *collect_by_mro* argument anymore.
  `#711 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/711>`_

`Full changelog <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html>`_.

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `subclassing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
