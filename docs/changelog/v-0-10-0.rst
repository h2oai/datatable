Columnsets
----------
The ``f``-symbol syntax has been extended to allow selecting multiple columns
from a frame at once, so-called *columnsets*. The primary use case here is to
select a slice of columns, or to select columns based on their type::

    f[:]         # select all columns
    f[:5]        # select the first 5 columns
    f["A":"Z"]   # select columns from 'A' to 'Z'
    f[float]     # select all floating point columns
    f[dt.int32]  # select all columns with stype int32
    f[int   if select_ints else
      float if select_floats else
      None]

In addition, columnsets can be added / subtracted, allowing to express a richer
selection of columns::

    f[int].extend(f[float])   # all integers and floating point columns
    f[:].remove(f[str])       # all columns except those of string type
    f[:10].extend(f[-1])      # first 10, plus the last column

The columnsets can be used in places where a list/sequence of columns is
expected, such as the ``i`` node of ``DT[i,j,...]``, the ``by()`` function;
also in functions that operate on lists of columns, such as ``rowsum()``,
``rowmin()``, etc.
