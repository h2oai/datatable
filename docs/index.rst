Introduction to Datatable
=========================

H2O's Datatable is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular data structures (aka data frames). It is close in spirit to [pandas] or [SFrame]; however we put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the package is closely related to R's [data.table] and attempts to mimic its core algorithms and API.

Currently `datatable` is in the Alpha stage and is undergoing active development. The API may be unstable; some of the core features are incomplete and/or missing. 

Python 3.5+ is required.
