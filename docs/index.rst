Introduction
============

Data is everywhere. From the smallest photon interactions to galaxy collisions,
from mouse movements on a screen to economic developments of countries, we are
surrounded by the sea of information. The human mind cannot comprehend this data in
all its complexity; since ancient times people found it much easier to reduce
the dimensionality, to impose a strict order, to arrange the data points neatly
on a rectangular grid: to make a **data table**.

But once the data has been collected into a table, it has been tamed. It may
still need some grooming and exercise, essentially so it is no longer scary. Even
if it is really Big Data, with the **right tools** you can approach it, play
with it, bend it to your will, *master* it.

Python ``datatable`` module is the right tool for the task. It is a library that
implements a wide (and growing) range of operators for manipulating
two-dimensional data frames. It focuses on: big data support, high performance,
both in-memory and out-of-memory datasets, and multi-threaded algorithms. In
addition, ``datatable`` strives to achieve good user experience, helpful error
messages, and powerful API similar to R ``data.table``'s.
