Introduction to Datatable
=========================

H2O's Datatable is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular data structures (aka data frames). It is close in spirit to `pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`__ or `SFrame <https://github.com/turi-code/SFrame>`__; however we put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the package is closely related to R's `data.table <https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table>`__ and attempts to mimic its core algorithms and API.

Currently `datatable` is in the Alpha stage and is undergoing active development. The API may be unstable; some of the core features are incomplete and/or missing. 

Python 3.5+ is required.
