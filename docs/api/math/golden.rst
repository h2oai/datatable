    The golden ratio :math:`\varphi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2`, also known as golden
    section. This is a number such that if :math:`a = \varphi b`, for some
    non-zero :math:`a` and :math:`b`, then it must also be true that
    :math:`a + b = \varphi a`.

    The constant is stored with `float64` precision, and its value is
    ``1.618033988749895``.
