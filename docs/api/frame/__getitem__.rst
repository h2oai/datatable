.. xmethod:: datatable.Frame.__getitem__
    :src: src/core/frame/__getitem__.cc Frame::_main_getset
    :signature: __getitem__(self, i, j[, by][, sort][, join])

    The main method for accessing data and computing on the frame. Sometimes
    we also refer to it as the ``DT[i, j, ...]`` call.

    Since Python does not support keyword arguments inside square brackets,
    all arguments are positional. The first is the *row selector* `i`, the
    second is the *column selector* `j`, and the rest are optional. Thus,
    ``DT[i, j]`` selects rows ``i`` and columns ``j`` from frame ``DT``.

    If an additional `by` argument is present, then the selectors `i` and
    `j` work within groups generated by the ``by()`` expression. The `sort`
    argument reorders the rows of the frame, and the `join` argument allows
    performing SQL joins between several frames.

    The signature listed here is the most generic. But there are also
    special-case signatures ``DT[j]`` and ``DT[i, j]`` described below.


    Parameters
    ----------
    i : int | slice | Frame | FExpr | List[bool] | List[Any]
        The row selector.

        If this is an integer or a slice, then the behavior is the same as in
        Python when working on a list with :attr:`.nrows`
        elements. In particular, the integer value must be within the range
        ``[-nrows; nrows)``. On the other hand when `i` is a slice, then either
        its start or end or both may be safely outside the row-range of the
        frame. The trivial slice ``:`` always selects all rows.

        `i` may also be a single-column boolean Frame. It must have the
        same number of rows as the current frame, and it serves as a mask for
        which rows are to be selected: ``True`` indicates that the row should
        be included in the result, while ``False`` and ``None`` skips the row.

        `i` may also be a single-column integer Frame. Such column specifies
        directly which row indices are to be selected. This is more flexible
        compared to a boolean column: the rows may be repeated, reordered,
        omitted, etc. All values in the column `i` must be in the range
        ``[0; nrows)`` or an error will be thrown. In particular, negative
        indices are not allowed. Also, if the column contains NA values, then
        it would produce an "invalid row", i.e. a row filled with NAs.

        `i` may also be an expression, which must evaluate into a single
        column, either boolean or integer. In this case the result is the
        same as described above for a single-column frame.

        When `i` is a list of booleans, then it is equivalent to a single-column
        boolean frame. In particular, the length of the list must be equal to
        :attr:`.nrows`.

        Finally, `i` can be a list of any of the above (integers, slices, frames,
        expressions, etc), in which case each element of the list is evaluated
        separately and then all selected rows are put together. The list may
        contain ``None``s, which will be simply skipped.

    j : int | str | slice | list | dict | type | FExpr | update
        This argument may either select columns, or perform computations with
        the columns.

        ``int``
            Select a single column at the specified index. A
            :exc:`dt.exceptions.IndexError` is raised if `j` is not in the
            range ``[-ncols; ncols)``.

        ``str``
            Select a single column by name. A :exc:`dt.exceptions.KeyError`
            is raised if the column with such a name does not exist.

        ``:``
            This is a trivial slice, and it means "select everything", and is
            roughly equivalent to SQL's ``*``. In the simple case of
            ``DT[i, j]`` call "selecting everything" means all columns from
            frame ``DT``. However, when the ``by()`` clause is added, then
            ``:`` will now select all columns except those used in the groupby.
            And if the expression has a ``join()``, then "selecting everything"
            will produce all columns from all frames, excluding those that were
            duplicate during a natural join.

        ``slice[int]``
            An integer slice can be used to select a subset of columns. The
            behavior of a slice is exactly the same as in base Python.

        ``slice[str]``
            A string slice is an expression like ``"colA":"colZ"``. In this
            case all columns from ``"colA"`` to ``"colZ"`` inclusive are
            selected. And if ``"colZ"`` appears before ``"colA``" in the frame,
            then the returned columns will be in the reverse order.

            Both endpoints of the slice must be valid columns (or omitted), or
            otherwise a :exc:`dt.exceptions.KeyError` will be raised.

        ``type`` | ``stype`` | ``ltype``
            Select only columns of the matching type.

        ``FExpr``
            An expression formula is computed within the current evaluation
            context (i.e. it takes into account the current frame, the filter
            ``i``, the presence of groupby/join parameters, etc). The result
            of this evaluation is used as-if that colum existed in the frame.

        ``List[bool]``
            If ``j`` is a list of boolean values, then it must have the length
            of :attr:`.ncols`, and it describes which columns are
            to be selected into the result.

        ``List[Any]``
            The ``j`` can also be a list of elements of any other type listed
            above, with the only restriction that the items must be homogeneous.
            For example, you can mix ``int``s and ``slice[int]``s, but not
            ``int``s and ``FExpr``s, or ``int``s and ``str``s.

            Each item in the list will be evaluated separately (as if each was
            the sole element in ``j``), and then all the results will be put
            together.

        ``Dict[str, FExpr]``
            A dictionary can be used to select columns/expressions similarly
            to a list, but assigning them explicit names.

        ``update``
            As a special case, the ``j`` argument may be the
            :func:`update() <datatable.update>` function, which turns the
            selection operation into an update. That is, instead of returning
            the chosen rows/columns, they will be updated instead with the
            user-supplied values.

    by : by
        When ``by()`` clause is present in the square brackets, the rest of the
        computations are carried out within the "context of a groupby". This
        should generally be equivalent to (a) splitting the frame into separate
        sub-frames corresponding to each group, (b) applying ``DT[i, j]``
        separately within each group, (c) row-binding the results for each
        group. In practice the following operations are affected:

        - all reduction operators such as :func:`dt.min()` or
          :func:`dt.sum()` now work separately within each
          group. Thus, instead of computing sum over the entire column, it is
          computed separately within each group in ``by()``, and the resulting
          column will have as many rows as the number of groups.

        - certain ``i`` expressions are re-interpreted as being applied within
          each group. For example, if ``i`` is an integer or a slice, then it
          will now be selecting row(s) within each group.

        - certain functions (such as :func:`dt.shift()`) are
          also "group-aware", and produce results that take into account the
          groupby context. Check documentation for each individual function
          to find out whether it has special treatment for groupby contexts.

        In addition, ``by()`` also affects the order of columns in the output
        frame. Specifically, all columns listed as the groupby keys will be
        automatically placed at the front of the resulting frame, and also
        excluded from ``:`` or ``f[:]`` within ``j``.

    sort : sort
        This argument can be used to rearrange rows in the resulting frame.
        See :func:`sort() <datatable.sort>` for details.

    join : join
        Performs a JOIN operation with another frame. The
        :func:`join() <datatable.join>` clause will calculate how the rows
        of the current frame match against the rows of the joined frame, and
        allow you to refer to the columns of the joined frame within `i`, `j`
        or `by`. In order to access columns of the joined frame use
        namespace ``g.``.

        This parameter may be listed multiple times if you need to join with
        several frames. However, for the moment, ``g.`` can only access
        columns of the first joined frame.

    return : Frame | None
        If `j` is an :func:`update() <datatable.update>` clause then current
        frame is modified in-place and nothing is returned.

        In all other cases, the returned value is a
        :class:`Frame <datatable.Frame>` object constructed from the selected
        rows and columns (including the computed columns) of the current frame.


    Details
    -------

    The order of evaluation of expressions is that first the `join` clause(s)
    are computed, creating a mapping between the rows of the current frame and
    the joined frame(s). After that we evaluate `by`+`sort`. Next, the `i`
    filter is applied creating the final index of rows that will be selected.
    Lastly, we evaluate the `j` part, taking into account the current groupby
    and row index(es).

    When evaluating `j`, it is essentially converted into a tree (DAG) of
    expressions, where each expression is evaluated from the bottom up. That
    is, we start evaluating from the leaf nodes (which are usually column
    selectors such as ``f[0]``), and then at each convert the set of columns
    into a new set. Importantly, each subexpression node may produce columns
    of 3 types: "scalar", "grouped", and "full-size". Whenever subexpressions
    of different levels are mixed together, they are upgraded to the highest
    level. Thus, a scalar may be reused for each group, and a grouped column
    can interoperate with a regular column by auto-expanding in such a way
    that it becomes constant within each group.

    If, after the `j` is fully evaluated, it produces a column set of type
    "grouped", then the resulting frame will have as many rows as there are
    groups. If, on the other hand, the column set is "full-size", then the
    resulting frame will have as many rows as the original frame.

.. xmethod:: datatable.Frame.__getitem__
    :src: src/core/frame/__getitem__.cc Frame::_get_single_column
    :noindex:
    :signature: __getitem__(self, j)

    Extract a single column `j` from the frame.

    The single-argument version of ``DT[i, j]`` works only for ``j`` being
    either an integer (indicating column index) or a string (column name).
    If you need any other way of addressing column(s) of the frame, use the
    more versatile ``DT[:, j]`` form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    j : int | str
        The index or name of a column to retrieve.

    return: Frame
        Single-column frame containing the column at the specified index or
        with the given name.

    except: KeyError | IndexError
        .. list-table::
            :widths: auto
            :class: api-table

            * - :exc:`KeyError <dt.exceptions.KeyError>`
              - raised if the column with the given name does not
                exist in the frame.

            * - :exc:`IndexError <dt.exceptions.IndexError>`
              - raised if the column does not exist at the provided
                index `j`.



.. xmethod:: datatable.Frame.__getitem__
    :src: src/core/frame/__getitem__.cc Frame::m__getitem__
    :noindex:
    :signature: __getitem__(self, i, j)

    Extract a single value from the frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i : int
        The index of a row

    j : int | str
        The index or name of a column.

    return : None | bool | int | float | str | object
        A single value from the frame's row `i` and column `j`.
