    The ``date32`` type represents a particular calendar date without a time
    component. Internally, this type is stored as a 32-bit signed integer
    counting the number of days since 1970-01-01 ("the epoch"). Thus, this
    type accommodates dates within the range of approximately ±5.8 million
    years.

    The calendar used for this type is `proleptic Gregorian`_, meaning that it
    extends the modern-day Gregorian calendar into the past before this calendar
    was first adopted.

    This type corresponds to ``datetime.date`` in Python, ``pa.date32()`` in
    pyarrow, and ``np.dtype('<M8[D]')`` in numpy.

    .. note::

        Python's ``datetime.date`` object can accommodate dates from year 1 to
        year 9999, which is much smaller than what ``date32`` type allows.
        As a consequence, when ``date32`` values that are outside of year range
        1-9999 are converted to python, they become integers instead of
        ``datetime.date`` objects.

        For the same reason the :attr:`.min` and :attr:`.max` properties of this
        type also return integers.
