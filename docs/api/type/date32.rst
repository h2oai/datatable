    The ``date32`` type is used to represent a particular calendar date without
    a time component. Internally, this type is stored as a 32-bit integer
    containing the number of days since the epoch (Jan 1, 1970). Thus, this
    type accommodates dates within the range of approximately Â±5.8 million
    years.

    The calendar used for this type is `proleptic Gregorian`_, meaning that it
    extends the modern-day Gregorian calendar into the past before this calendar
    was first adopted.

    This type corresponds to ``datetime.date`` in Python, ``pa.date32()`` in
    pyarrow, and ``np.dtype('<M8[D]')`` in numpy.
