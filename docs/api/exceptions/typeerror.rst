.. xexc:: datatable.exceptions.TypeError
    :src: --

    One of the most common exceptions raised by :mod:`datatable`, this occurs
    when either a function receives an argument of unexpected type, or incorrect
    number of arguments, or whenever an operation is requested on a column whose
    type is not suitable for that operation.

    Inherits from Python :py:exc:`TypeError` and :exc:`datatable.exceptions.DtException`.
