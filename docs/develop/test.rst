Test page
=========

This is a test page, it has no useful content. It's sole purpose is to collect
various elements of markup to ensure that they render properly in the current
theme. For developers we recommend to visually check this page after any tweak
to the accompanying CSS files.

If you notice any visual irregularities somewhere else within the documentation,
please add those examples to this file as a kind of manual "test".


Headers
-------
This section is dedicated to headers of various levels. Note that there can be
only one level-1 header (at the top of the page). All other headers are
therefore level-2 or smaller. At the same time, headers below level 4 are not
supported.

Sub-header A
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Paragraph within a subheader. Please check that the spacing between the headers
and the text looks reasonable.

Sub-sub header A.1
++++++++++++++++++
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Sub-sub header A.2
++++++++++++++++++
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Sub-header B
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nothing to see here, move along citizen.


Paragraphs and lists
--------------------

Embedding lists into text may be somewhat tricky, for example here's the list
that contains a short enumeration of items. It is supposed to be rendered in
a "compact" style:

- one
- two
- three

Compare this to the following list, which is supposed to be rendered with more
spacing between the elements:

- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

- Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
  aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
  voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

- Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia
  deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

The next section demonstrates how different kinds of lists nest within each
other.

Bill of Rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting
the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or
abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should
