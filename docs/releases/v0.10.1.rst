  Frame
  -----

  .. ref-context:: datatable.Frame

  -[api] A Python list of integers containing only 0s and 1s will now produce
    an ``int8`` column instead of ``bool8``. In order to create a boolean
    column supply a list of Trues and Falses, or force the boolean stype with
    the constructor parameter ``stype=bool``::

        assert dt.Frame([False, True]) == dt.bool8
        assert dt.Frame([0, 1]).stype == dt.int8
        assert dt.Frame([0, 1], stype=bool).stype == dt.bool8
        assert dt.Frame([0, 1, 2]).stype == dt.int32

  -[fix] A list of frames now displays properly in Jupyter Lab. (#2222)

  -[fix] Mixing reduce and map operations should no longer produce error
    "Unable to create a nested thread team". (#2242)

  -[fix] Fix rare deadlock when creating a Frame from a python list. The
    deadlock occurred only on ppc64le and datatable compiled with gcc
    version 4.8 or earlier. (#2250)

  -[fix] Fixed an error when a frame with a computed boolean column was
    saved into a CSV file. [#2253]


  General
  -------

  .. ref-context:: datatable

  -[api] Properties ``dt.bool8.min`` and ``dt.bool8.max`` are now equal to
    ``False`` and ``True`` respectively, instead of integers 0 and 1. (#2231)

  -[enh] :func:`fread` is now able to read Jay files even if the file doesn't
    have the ``.jay`` extension.



  FTRL model
  ----------

  .. ref-context:: datatable.models.Ftrl

  -[fix] Fix feature importance normalization to [0, 1] in FTRL. (#2224)

  -[fix] Resetting an untrained FTRL model now doesn't result in a segfault.
    (#2226)

  -[enh] The "id" column in FTRL model's frame :attr:`.labels` now has stype
    ``int32`` instead of ``bool8`` for binomial and regression models.
