  Columnsets
  ----------

  .. seealso:: :ref:`columnsets`

  The ``f``-symbol syntax has been extended to allow selecting multiple columns
  from a frame at once, so-called *columnsets*. The primary use case here is to
  select a slice of columns, or to select columns based on their type::

      >>> f[:]         # select all columns
      >>> f[:5]        # select the first 5 columns
      >>> f["A":"Z"]   # select columns from 'A' to 'Z'
      >>> f[float]     # select all floating point columns
      >>> f[dt.int32]  # select all columns with stype int32
      >>> f[int   if select_ints else
      ...   float if select_floats else
      ...   None]

  In addition, columnsets can be added/subtracted, allowing to express a richer
  selection of columns::

      >>> f[int].extend(f[float])   # all integers and floating point columns
      >>> f[:].remove(f[str])       # all columns except those of string type
      >>> f[:10].extend(f[-1])      # first 10, plus the last column

  The columnsets can be used in places where a list/sequence of columns is
  expected, such as the ``j`` node of ``DT[i,j,...]``, the ``by()`` function, etc.


  Row-functions
  -------------

  We added a family of new "row-wise" aggregation functions, which operate on
  any number of columns in a frame, producing a single column as a result. These
  function aggregate across rows instead of columns (like traditional reducers),
  and therefore they all have prefix ``row``::

      >>> rowall()    # are all values True?
      >>> rowany()    # is there any True value?
      >>> rowcount()  # count non-missing values in a row
      >>> rowfirst()  # find the first non-missing value
      >>> rowlast()   # the last non-missing value
      >>> rowmax()    # largest value in a row
      >>> rowmean()   # mean of all values in a row
      >>> rowmin()    # smallest value in a row
      >>> rowsd()     # standard deviation of all row values
      >>> rowsum()    # the sum of values in a row

  These functions are equivalent to pandas' aggregation functions with parameter
  ``(axis=1)``. In addition, the first two of these functions (``rowall()`` and
  ``rowany()``) use short-circuit evaluation.


  Mathematical functions
  ----------------------

  New module :mod:`datatable.math` now has implementations of most mathematical
  functions found in numpy or in standard Python math module. These functions
  work with Frame objects, and can be used in ``DT[i,j,...]`` expressions::

      >>> DT[:, f.X * dt.math.cos(f.Phi) + f.Y * dt.math.sin(f.Phi)]

  There are 48 functions in total.


  Frame
  -----
  .. current-class:: datatable.Frame

  -[new] Added function :func:`dt.update`, which can be used to in a ``DT[i, j]``
    expression. This function can be used in the ``j`` place, and it allows the
    user to create new columns in a Frame, or update the existing ones::

      >>> DT = dt.Frame(A=range(5))
      >>> DT[:, update(A=f.A * 2, B=dt.str32(f.A), Z=0)]

  -[new] Added method :meth:`.export_names()`
    which returns a tuple of variables referencing each column in the Frame::

      >>> PROC_ID, SORT_NR, *other = DT.export_names()
      >>> DT[(PROC_ID == "A") & (SORT_NR > 2), :]

    If you need to export only a subset of columns, you can select those columns
    first via the standard ``DT[i, j]`` syntax::

      >>> # Only create variables for the first 5 columns
      >>> A, B, C, D, E = DT[:, :5].export_names()

  -[new] Added frame property :attr:`.stype` which is
    similar to :attr:`.stypes` except that it returns
    a single stype instead of a tuple. This method can only be used on a frame
    where all columns have the same stype, or there is only one column.

  -[enh] When a frame is displayed in a console, it will now display the first
    15 + the last 5 rows, similarly to how it is rendered in Jupyter notebook.
    Also, if the frame is 30 rows or less, it will be shown in full.

    These parameters are configurable via the options
    ``dt.options.display.head_nrows``, ``dt.options.display.tail_nrows`` and
    ``dt.options.display.max_nrows``.

  -[enh] Method :meth:`.copy()` now has a new
    parameter ``deep=False``. When set to ``True``, it will create a deep copy
    of the frame instead of the usual shallow one.

    In addition, standard python functions ``copy.copy()`` and ``copy.deepcopy()``
    will now defer to the ``Frame.copy()`` method too.

  -[enh] It is now possible to create a Frame from a list of numpy integers/
    floats. The resulting Frame will have the stype corresponding to the largest
    dtype among all elements in the list::

      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> DT = dt.Frame([np.int32(1), np.int32(3), np.int64(8)])
      >>> assert DT.shape == (3, 1)
      >>> assert DT.stype == dt.int64

  -[enh] When an integer column is used to select rows from a Frame, that column
    is now allowed to contain NA values, which produces a row filled with missing
    values::

      >>> DT = dt.Frame(A=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
      >>> rows = dt.Frame([2, 0, None, 1, 2])
      >>> assert DT[rows, :].to_list() == [['c', 'a', None, 'b', 'c']]

  -[new] Added option ``display.max_column_width``. Cells whose content is larger
    than this value will be automatically truncated when a Frame is rendered into
    a terminal.

  -[enh] When selecting the key column from a keyed frame ``DT[key]``, the
    resulting single-column frame will now retain its "keyed" property.

  -[enh] Method :meth:`.to_csv()` gains two new boolean
    parameters: ``header=`` and ``append=``. The ``header=`` parameter controls
    whether or not to write into the output the header row with column names. The
    ``append=`` parameter allows the CSV content to be appended to an existing
    file instead of overwriting it::

      >>> DT.to_csv("out.log", append=True)  # infer that header=False if file exists

  -[enh] Range objects can now be used directly in ``DT[i, j]`` expressions in any
    place where a column could be expected::

      >>> DT["id"] = range(1000)

  -[enh] Implemented ability to select a specific row within each group, using
    the syntax::

      >>> DT[2, :, by(f.GRP)]

    If the index is invalid for some of the groups, those groups will be
    discarded.

  -[enh] Assigning a python type or an stype to a column or set of columns will
    now perform a type-cast on those columns::

      >>> DT["A"] = int            # Column A in frame DT will become integer
      >>> DT[:, int] = dt.float64  # All integer columns will be converted to float64

  -[enh] Method ``Frame.materialize()`` gains a new option ``to_memory=False``.
    If set to True, it will force the Frame's data to be lifted from disk into
    the main memory (if the frame was opened from disk)::

      >>> DT = dt.fread("data.jay")
      >>> DT.materialize(to_memory=True)

  -[api] The name deduplication algorithm now starts looking for candidate names
    starting from ``name + dt.options.frame.name_auto_index``. For example, if
    you're creating a Frame with column names ``["A", "A", "A"]``, then those names
    will be modified to ensure uniqueness. Before, they were changed into ``["A",
    "A.1", "A.2"]``; now they are changed into ``["A", "A.0", "A.1"]`` (assuming
    the value of option ``frame.name_auto_index`` is ``0``).

  -[api] Frame created from a python list of small integers will now have stype
    ``int32``, instead of ``int8`` or ``int16`` as before. One can still create
    a column of type ``int8`` by requesting this stype explicitly::

      >>> DT1 = dt.Frame([1, 2, 3])
      >>> DT2 = dt.Frame([1, 2, 3], stype=dt.int8)
      >>> assert DT1.stype == dt.int32
      >>> assert DT2.stype == dt.int8

    Thanks to @Viktor-Demin for the contribution. (#2127)

  -[fix] Keyed columns are now styled distinctly from regular columns when
    rendering the Frame into a Jupyter notebook. (#1636)

  -[fix] In Jupyter notebook Frame's stylesheets are now injected during
    the datatable import. This makes it less likely that the stylesheets will
    get accidentally removed from the page. However, if it still does occur,
    there is now also a method to load those styles directly:
    :func:`dt.init_styles`. (#1871)

  -[fix] Fixed error when displaying ``help(dt)``. (#1931)

  -[fix] ``fread(cmd=)`` now throws an error if it occurred while running the
    provided command `cmd` in the shell. Previously the error was silently
    discarded. (#1935)

  -[fix] Creating a Frame from a degenerate range now produces an empty Frame
    instead of a 1-row Frame. (#1942)

  -[fix] Fixed crash when computing mode stat for a view frame. (#1953)

  -[fix] Fixed a bug where creating a new column via assignment would crash if
    the RHS of the assignment contained an expression that tried to use the
    column that was being created. (#1983)

  -[fix] Fixed a crash when joining a frame that had 0 rows. (#1988)

  -[fix] Increasing the number of rows in a keyed Frame was documented as
    invalid, but didn't actually throw any errors. Now it does. (#2021)

  -[fix] Operations on a 0-row frame containing string columns will no
    longer cause an infinite loop. (#2043)

  -[fix] Conversion of a Frame into a masked numpy array was sometimes done
    incorrectly when some columns in the frame contained NAs, while others
    did not. (#2050)

  -[fix] Groupby operation on an empty (0-rows) frame now works correctly,
    returning a 0-row result frame. (#2078) For example::

      >>> DT = dt.Frame(Id=[], Value=[])  # create a 0x2 frame
      >>> DT[:, sum(f.Value), by(f.Id)]   # produces a 0x2 frame
      >>> DT[:, sum(f.Value)]             # produces a 1x1 frame

  -[fix] Deleting columns from a keyed Frame no longer results in a crash
    when the deleted columns are part of the key. (#2083)

  -[fix] The :func:`dt.count` reducer now always produces a column with stype
    ``int64``. Before, it sometimes produced an ``int32`` column, and sometimes
    an ``int64`` column.

  -[fix] Setting a key on a copied frame no longer affects the original
    frame. (#2095)

  -[fix] When a Frame has a string column containing special characters (such
    as newlines, tabs, or others from C0/C1 blocks), they will now be properly
    escaped when the frame is printed in a console. In addition, we now attempt
    to detect and properly handle 0-width and double-width characters in strings,
    so that when a column containing such unicode characters is displayed, it
    should not cause mis-alignment issues.

  -[fix] Option ``dt.options.display.allow_unicode`` is now respected when
    printing a Frame containing string columns with unicode data. These values
    will now be properly escaped if the option value is ``False``.

  -[fix] Function :func:`dt.math.isna` now returns correct result for a column
    obtained from joining another frame, provided that the join was only
    partially successful. (#2109)

  -[fix] Fix creation of a Frame from a numpy array which was obtained from
    another numpy array as a slice with a negative stride. (#2163)


  General
  -------
  .. current-module:: datatable

  -[api] We no longer export symbols ``dt.open()``, ``dt.abs()``, :func:`min`,
    :func:`max` and :func:`sum` from datatable module when doing
    ``from datatable import *``. They are still available when looked up
    explicitly, i.e. ``dt.open()`` will still work.

  -[api] Function ``dt.open()`` is marked as deprecated, scheduled to be
    removed in version 0.12. Instead we recommend to use :func:`fread`
    function to open Jay files.

  -[api] Support for NFF format was removed. This was an old datatable's format
    for storing data frames on disk, and it was deprecated in favor of Jay over a
    year ago. If you still have any data stored in NFF format, we recommend to
    re-save in Jay using datatable 0.9.

  -[enh] Datatable module now exports symbol ``dt``, which is the handle to
    the module itself. For example, you can now write::

      >>> from datatable import dt, f, by, join

    The symbol ``dt`` is also exported by default, i.e. it will be available if
    you do ``from datatable import *``.

  -[new] Added functions :func:`cov` and :func:`corr` to compute the covariance
    and Pearson correlation coefficient between columns of a Frame. These
    functions can be used in a group-by too::

      >>> # Compute correlation of columns A and B, group-wise by ID
      >>> DT[:, corr(f.A, f.B), by(f.ID)]

  -[new] Added function :func:`shift` which can be used to generate lags/leads
    of a column. For example::

      >>> DT[:, {"lag2": shift(f.A, n=2),
      ...        "lag1": shift(f.A),       # same as shift(f.A, n=1)
      ...        "lag0": f.A,              # same as shift(f.A, n=0)
      ...        "lead1": shift(f.A, -1),
      ...        "lead2": shift(f.A, -2),
      ...        }]

    This function is group-aware: when used in an expression containing a groupby,
    it will apply the shift separately within each group.

  -[fix] Fixed memory leak when writing a Frame into a CSV file. (#2119)

  -[fix] Fixed memory leak when converting a numpy array with string values
    into a Frame. (#2123)

  -[fix] Fixed memory leak during reduce operations. (#2125)

  -[fix] Column method ``.len()`` for computing string length now handles
    unicode strings correctly and returns the number of codepoints in the
    string instead of the number of bytes. (#2160)


  Internal
  --------

  -[api] Function ``dt.internal.frame_column_rowindex(DT, i)`` was removed and
    replaced with ``dt.internal.frame_columns_virtual(DT)``. The latter returns
    a tuple of True/False indicators of whether each column in a Frame is
    virtual or not.

  -[api] C API version increased to 2.

  -[api] Removed C API methods and macros related to retrieval of a column's
    rowindex:

    - ``DtFrame_ColumnRowindex()``,
    - ``DtRowindex_Check()``,
    - ``DtRowindex_Type()``,
    - ``DtRowindex_Size()``,
    - ``DtRowindex_UnpackSlice()``,
    - ``DtRowindex_ArrayData()``,
    - ``DtRowindex_NONE``,
    - ``DtRowindex_ARR32``,
    - ``DtRowindex_ARR64``,
    - ``DtRowindex_SLICE``

  -[api] Added C API method ``DtFrame_ColumnIsVirtual()`` which returns a boolean
    indicator whether the column in a Frame is virtual or not.
