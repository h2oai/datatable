  .. ref-context:: datatable


  -[enh] Added ability to delete rows from a view Frame.

  -[enh] Implemented :func:`countna()` function for ``obj64`` columns.

  -[new] New option ``dt.options.core_logger`` to help debug datatable.

  -[new] New Frame method :meth:`Frame.materialize()` to convert a view Frame
    into a "real" one. This method is noop if applied to a non-view Frame.

  -[enh] Added several internal options to fine-tune the performance of sorting
    algorithm.

  -[enh] Significantly improved performance of sorting doubles.

  -[enh] :func:`fread` can now read string columns that are larger than 2GB in
    size.

  -[enh] :func:`fread` can now accept a list/tuple of stypes for its ``columns``
    parameter.

  -[enh] Improved logic for auto-assigning column names when they are missing.

  -[enh] :func:`fread` now supports reading files that contain NUL characters.

  -[new] Added global settings ``options.frame.names_auto_index`` and
    ``options.frame.names_auto_prefix`` to control automatic column name
    generation in a Frame.

  -[enh] Eliminated all ``assert()`` statements from C code, and replaced them
    with exception throws.

  -[api] When creating a column of "object" type, we will now coerce float NaN
    values into ``None``.

  -[api] Renamed :func:`fread`'s parameter ``strip_white`` into
    ``strip_whitespace``.

  -[api] Default column names, if none given by the user, are "C0", "C1", ...
    for both :func:`fread` and :class:`Frame` constructor.

  -[api] function-valued ``columns`` parameter in :func:`fread` has been
    changed: if previously the function was invoked for every column, now it
    receives the list of all columns at once, and is expected to return a
    modified list (or dict / set / etc). Each column description in the list
    that the function receives carries the columns name and stype, in the
    future ``format`` field will also be added.

  -[fix] :func:`fread` will no longer consume excessive amounts of memory when
    reading a file with too many columns and few rows.

  -[fix] fixed a possible crash when reading CSV file containing long string
    fields.

  -[fix] :func:`fread` NA fields with whitespace were not recognized correctly.

  -[fix] :func:`fread` will no longer emit error messages or type-bump variables
    due to incorrectly recognized chunk boundaries.

  -[fix] Fixed a crash when rbinding string column with non-string: now an
    exception will be thrown instead.

  -[fix] Calling any stats function on a column of obj64 type will no longer
    result in a crash.

  -[fix] Columns/rows slices no longer fail on an empty Frame.

  -[fix] Fixed crash when materializing a view frame containing obj64 columns.

  -[fix] Fixed erroneous grouping calculations.

  -[fix] Fixed sorting of 1-row view frames.
