  .. ref-context:: datatable


  -[enh] Implemented sorting for ``str64`` columns.

  -[enh] :func:`write_csv` can now write columns of type ``str64``.

  -[enh] :func:`fread` can now accept a list of files to read, or a glob
    pattern.

  -[new] Added ``dt.lib.core.has_omp_support()`` to check whether
    ``datatable`` was built with OMP support or not.

  -[enh] Save per-column min/max information in the NFF format.

  -[fix] Fix the source distribution (sdist) by including all the files that
    are required for building from source.

  -[fix] Install no longer fails with ``llvmlite==0.23.0`` package.

  -[fix] Fixed a stall in fread when using single-threaded mode with
    ``fill=True``.
