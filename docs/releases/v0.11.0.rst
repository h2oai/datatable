  Frame
  -----
  .. ref-context:: datatable.Frame

  -[new] Property :attr:`Frame.source` will contain the name of the file
    where the frame was loaded from. If the frame was modified after loading,
    or if it was created dynamically to begin with, this property will
    return ``None``.

  -[new] The expression ``len(DT)`` now works, and returns the number of
    columns in the Frame. This allows the Frame to be used in contexts where
    an iterable might be expected.

  -[new] Added ability to cast string columns into numeric types: int, float
    or boolean. [#1313]

  -[new] String columns now support comparison operators ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``
    and ``>=``. [#2274]

  -[new] String columns can now be added together, similarly to how strings
    can be added in Python. [#1839]

  -[new] Added a new function :func:`cut()` to bin numeric data
    to equal-width discrete intervals. [#2483]

  -[new] Added a new function :func:`qcut()` to bin data
    to equal-population discrete intervals. [#1680]

  -[new] Added function :func:`round() <datatable.math.round>` which is the
    equivalent of Python's built-in ``round()``. [#2285]

  -[enh] Method :meth:`Frame.colindex()` now accepts a column selector
    f-expression as an argument.

  -[enh] When creating a Frame from a python list, it is now possible to
    explicitly specify the stype of the resulting column by "dividing" the
    list by the type you need::

        dt.Frame(A=[1, 5, 10] / dt.int64,
                 B=[0, 0, 0] / dt.float64)

  -[enh] Added new argument ``bom=False`` to the :meth:`Frame.to_csv()` method.
    If set to ``True``, it will add the Byte-Order Mark (BOM) to the output
    CSV file. [#2379]

  -[enh] Casting a column into its own type is now a no-op. [#2425]

  -[enh] It is now possible to create a Frame from a pandas DataFrame with
    Categorical columns (which will be converted into strings). [#2407]

  -[api] Method :meth:`.cbind()` now throws an :exc:`InvalidOperationError`
    instead of a ``ValueError`` if the argument frames have incompatible
    shapes.

  -[api] Method :meth:`.colindex()` now throws an :exc:`KeyError` when given
    a column that doesn't exist in the frame, or an :exc:`IndexError` if
    given a numeric column index outside of the allowed range. Previously it
    was throwing a ``ValueError`` in both cases.

  -[api] When creating a Frame from a list containing mixed integers/floats
    and strings, the resulting Frame will now have stype ``str32``. Previously
    an ``obj64`` column was created instead. The new behavior is more
    consistent with fread's behavior when reading CSV files.

  -[api] Expression `f[:]` now excludes groupby columns when used in a
    groupby context. [#2460]

  -[api] Parameters ``_strategy=`` in :meth:`.to_csv()` and :meth:`.to_jay()`
    were renamed into ``method=``. The old parameter name still works, so this
    change is not breaking.

  -[fix] Deleting a key from the Frame (``del DT.key``) no longer causes a
    seg.fault. [#2357]

  -[fix] Casting a 0-row ``str32`` column into ``str64`` stype no longer goes
    into an infinite loop. [#2369]

  -[fix] Fixed creation of a ``str64`` column from a python list of strings
    when the total size of all strings is greater than 2GB. [#2368]

  -[fix] Rbinding several ``str32`` columns such that their combined string
    buffers have size over 2GB now properly creates a ``str64`` column as a
    result. [#2367]

  -[fix] Fixed crash when writing to CSV a frame with many boolean columns
    when the option ``quoting="all"`` is used. [#2382]

  -[fix] It is no longer allowed to combine ``compression="gzip"`` and
    ``append=True`` in :meth:`.to_csv()`.

  -[fix] Empty strings no longer get confused with NA strings in
    :meth:`.replace()`. [#2502]


  Fread
  -----

  -[new] Added new function :func:`iread()`, which is similar to
    :func:`fread()`, but suitable for reading multiple sources at once. The
    function will return an iterator of Frames.

    Use this function to read multiple files using a glob, or give it a list
    of files, or an archive containing multiple files inside, or an Excel
    file with multiple sheets, etc.

    The function :func:`iread()` has parameter ``errors=`` which controls
    what shouold happen when some of the sources cannot be read. Possible
    values are: ``"warn"``, ``"raise"``, ``"ignore"`` and ``"store"``. The
    latter will catch the exceptions that may occur when reading each
    input, and return those exception objects within the iterator. [#2008]

  -[new] It is now possible to read multi-file ``.tar.gz`` files using
    :func:`iread()`. [#2392]

  -[new] Added parameter ``encoding`` which will force fread to decode the
    input using the specified encoding before attempting to read it. The
    decoding process uses standard python codecs, and is therefore
    single-threaded. The parameter accepts any value available via the standard
    python library ``codecs``. [#2395]

  -[new] Added parameter ``memory_limit`` which instructs fread to try to limit
    the amount of memory used when reading the input. This parameter is
    especially useful when reading files that are larger than the amount of
    available memory. [#1750]

  -[enh] Added parameter ``multiple_sources`` which controls fread's
    behavior when multiple input sources are detected (for example, if you
    pass a name of an archive, and the archive contains multiple files).
    Possible values are: ``"warn"`` (default), ``"error"``, and ``"ignore"``.

  -[enh] Fread now displays a progress bar when downloading data from a URL.
    [#2441]

  -[enh] Fread now computes NA counts of all data while reading, storing
    them in per-column stats. For integer and floating point columns we also
    compute min/max value in each column. [#1097]

  -[enh] When reading from a URL, fread will now escape url-unsafe characters
    in that URL, so that the user doesn't have to.

  -[fix] When reading Excel files, the cells with datetime or boolean types
    are now handled correctly, in particular a datetime value is converted
    into its string representation. [#1701]

  -[fix] Fread now properly detects ``\r``-newlines in the presence of fields
    with quoted ``\n``-newlines. [#1343]

  -[fix] Opening Jay file from a bytes object now produces a Frame that
    remains valid even after the bytes object is deleted. [#2547]

  -[api] Function :func:`fread()` now always returns a single Frame object;
    previously it could return a dict of Frames if multiple sources were
    detected. Use :func:`iread()` if you need to read multi-source input.


  General
  -------
  .. ref-context:: datatable

  -[new] datatable is now fully supported on Windows.

  -[new] Added exception :exc:`InvalidOperationError`, which can be used to
    signal when an operation is requested that would be illegal for the given
    combination of parameters.

  -[new] New option ``dt.options.debug.enabled`` will report all calls to the
    internal C++ core functions, together with their timings. This may help
    identify performance bottlenecks, or help troubleshooting user scripts.

    Additional options ``debug.logger``, ``debug.report_args`` and
    ``debug.max_arg_size`` allow more granular control over the logging
    process. [#2452]

  -[new] Function ``ifelse(cond, expr_if_true, expr_if_false)`` can return
    one of the two values based on the condition. [#2411] ::

        DT["max(x,y)"] = ifelse(f.x >= f.y, f.x, f.y)

  -[enh] datatable no longer has modules ``blessed`` and ``typesentry`` as
    dependencies. [#1677] [#1535]

  -[enh] Added 2 new fields into the ``dt.build_info`` struct: ``.git_date``
    is the UTC timestamp of the git revision from which that version of
    datatable was built, and ``.git_diff`` which will be non-empty for builds
    from code that was modified compared to the git revision they are based on.

  -[enh] During a fork the thread pool will now shut down completely, together
    with the monitor thread. The threads will then restart in both the parent
    and the child, when needed. [#2438]

  -[fix] Internal function :func:`frame_column_data_r` now works properly with
    virtual columns. [#2269]

  -[fix] Avoid rare deadlock when creating a frame from pandas DataFrame in
    a forked process, in the datatable compiled with gcc version before 7.0.
    [#2272]

  -[fix] Fix rare crash in the interrupt signal handler. [#2282]

  -[fix] Fixed possible crash in :func:`rbind()` and :func:`union()` when
    they were called with a string argument, or with an object that caused
    infinite recursion. [#2386]

  -[fix] Column names containing backticks now display properly in error
    messages. [#2406]

  -[fix] Fixed rare race condition when multiple threads tried to throw an
    exception at the same time. [#2526]

  -[api] All exceptions thrown by datatable are now declared in the
    ``datatable.exceptions`` module. These exceptions are now organized to
    derive from the common base class ``DtException``.

    The exception messages when stringified no longer contain backticks. The
    backticks are still emitted internally to help display the error in a
    color-supporting terminal, but when the exception is converted into a
    string via `str()` or `repr()`, these backticks will now be stripped.
    This change ensures that the exception message remains the same regardless
    of how it is rendered.


  FTRL model
  ----------
  .. ref-context:: datatable.models.Ftrl

  -[enh] :attr:`models.Ftrl.nepochs`, the number of epochs to train the model, can now
    be a float rather than an integer.

  -[enh] :meth:`models.Ftrl.fit()` now throws :exc:`TypeError` when ltypes in the
   training and validation frames are not consistent.

  -[api] :attr:`models.Ftrl.interactions` now throws an :exc:`ValueError`
    instead of a :exc:`TypeError` when assigning interactions
    having zero features.

  -[fix] Fixed inconsistency in progress reporting. [#2520]
