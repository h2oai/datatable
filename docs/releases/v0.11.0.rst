  Frame
  -----
  .. ref-context:: datatable.Frame

  -[enh] String columns now support comparison operators ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``
    and ``>=``. [#2274]

  -[enh] Method :meth:`Frame.colindex()` now accepts a column selector
    f-expression as an argument.

  -[api] Method :meth:`.cbind()` now throws an :exc:`InvalidOperationError`
    instead of a ``ValueError`` if the argument frames have incompatible
    shapes.

  -[api] Method :meth:`.colindex()` now throws an :exc:`KeyError` when given
    a column that doesn't exist in the frame, or an :exc:`IndexError` if
    given a numeric column index outside of the allowed range. Previously it
    was throwing a ``ValueError`` in both cases.

  -[api] When creating a Frame from a list containing mixed integers / floats
    and strings, the resulting Frame will now have stype ``str32``. Previously
    an ``obj64`` column was created instead. The new behavior is more
    consistent with fread's behavior when reading CSV files.

  -[bug] Deleting a key from the Frame (``del DT.key``) no longer causes a
    seg.fault. [#2357]


  Fread
  -----

  -[fix] When reading Excel files, the cells with datetime or boolean types
    are now handled correctly, in particular a datetime value is converted
    into its string representation. [#1701]


  General
  -------
  .. ref-context:: datatable

  -[new] Added exception :exc:`InvalidOperationError`, which can be used to
    signal when an operation is requested that would be illegal for the given
    combination of parameters.

  -[enh] Datatable no longer lists module ``blessed`` as a dependency.
    [#1677]

  -[fix] Internal function :func:`frame_column_data_r` now works properly with
    virtual columns. [#2269]

  -[fix] Avoid rare deadlock when creating a frame from pandas DataFrame in
    a forked process, in the datatable compiled with gcc version before 7.0.
    [#2272]

  -[fix] Fix rare crash in the interrupt signal handler. [#2282]


  FTRL model
  ----------
  .. ref-context:: datatable.models.Ftrl

  -[enh] :attr:`.nepochs`, the number of epochs to train the model, can now
    be a float rather than an integer.
