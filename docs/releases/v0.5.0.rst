  General
  -------
  .. current-module:: datatable

  -[new] New function :func:`rbind()` to perform out-of-place row binding.

  -[enh] :func:`rbind`-ing now works on columns of all types (including between
    any types).

  -[enh] Added ability to change the number of rows in a Frame.

  -[new] It's now possible to modify a Frame in-place by assigning new values
    to particular cells.

  -[new] Created ``dt.__git_version__`` variable containing the commit hash from
    which the package was built.

  -[new] Added ability to read ``.bz2`` compressed files with :func:`fread`.

  -[enh] Fread can now properly recognize quoted NA strings.

  -[fix] Ensure that :func:`fread` only emits messages to Python from the main
    thread.

  -[fix] Fixed an error when unbounded f-expressions were printed to console.

  -[fix] Fixed problems when operating with too many memory-mapped Frames
    simultaneously.

  -[fix] Fixed incorrect groupby calculation in some rare cases.
