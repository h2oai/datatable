    statistics.

  -[new] Implemented statistics ``min``, ``max``, ``mean``, ``stdev``,
    ``countna`` for numeric and boolean columns.

  -[new] Getter ``df.internal.rowindex`` allows access to the RowIndex on the
    DataTable (for inspection/reuse).

  -[enh] In addition to LLVM4 environmental variable, datatable will now also

  -[new] If ``d0`` is a DataTable, then ``d1 = DataTable(d0)`` will create its
    shallow copy.
