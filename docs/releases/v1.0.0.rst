    .. current-module:: datatable

    -[new] Function :func:`ifelse()` can now accept more than 3 arguments,
      implementing a chained-if functionality. This is equivalent to
      ``CASE WHEN`` in SQL. [#2656]

    -[fix] When a whole column is updated within a ``DT[i, j, by()]`` call,
      the stype/ltype of that column us now allowed to change. [#2685]

    fread
    -----

    -[fix] Fix an error when reading a file with uneven number of fields
      and having Windows-style newlines. [#2681]


    General
    -------

    -[api] Datatable no longer supports Python 3.5, because Python 3.5 itself
      has reached its end of life on 2020-09-13 and will no longer be
      supported. If you are still using Python 3.5, please consider upgrading.
      [#2642]
