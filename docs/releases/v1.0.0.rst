    Frame
    -----
    .. current-class:: datatable.Frame

    -[new] :attr:`.meta` property now provides access to frame's meta
      information, if any, as set by datatable functions/methods or
      by the user.

    -[enh] The row selector ``i`` in the delete operation ``del DT[i, :]``
      can now be an unsorted list. The list can also contain duplicate
      values.

    FExpr
    -----
    .. current-module:: datatable

    -[new] Function :func:`ifelse()` can now accept more than 3 arguments,
      implementing a chained-if functionality. This is equivalent to
      ``CASE WHEN`` in SQL. [#2656]

    -[new] New function :func:`as_type()` that allows casting columns into
      a different stype. This function is an alternative to the already
      existing functionality of using the stype itself as a cast function.

    -[enh] Function :func:`sort()` can now accept argument ``na_positon=``.
      It can take three values: ``"first"`` (default), ``"last"`` and
      ``"remove"``. The values describe the position assigned to NAs after
      sorting. [#793]

    -[fix] When a whole column is updated within a ``DT[i, j, by()]`` call,
      the stype/ltype of that column us now allowed to change. [#2685]

    fread
    -----

    -[fix] Fix an error when reading a file with uneven number of fields
      and having Windows-style newlines. [#2681]

    -[fix] Fread no longer throws an exception when the list of column types
      passed to parameter ``columns=`` contains ``str64``. [#2704]


    General
    -------

    -[api] Datatable no longer supports Python 3.5, because Python 3.5 itself
      has reached its end of life on 2020-09-13 and will no longer be
      supported. If you are still using Python 3.5, please consider upgrading.
      [#2642]

    -[fix] Fixed a memory leak when creating a large number of datatable
      objects. [#2701]
