Contributors
------------

This page lists all people who have contributed to the development of
``datatable``. We take into account both code and documentation contributions,
as well as contributions in the form of bug reports and feature requests.

More specifically, a *code contribution* is considered any PR (pull request)
that was merged into the codebase. The "complexity" of the PR is not taken
into account as it is highly subjective. Next, an *issue contribution* is
any closed issue except for those that are tagged as "question", "wont-fix"
or "cannot-reproduce". Issues are attributed according to their closing date,
not their creation date.

In the table, the contributors are sorted according to their total contribution
score, which is the weighted sum of the count of each user's code and issue
contributions. Code contributions have more weight than issue contributions,
and more recent contributions more weight than the older ones.

**Developer's note**: This table is auto-generated based on contributor lists
in each of the version files, specified via the ``..contributors::`` directive.
In turn, the list of contributors for each version has to be generated via
the script ``ci/gh.py`` at the time of each release. The issues/PRs will be
filtered according to their milestone. Thus, the issues/PRs that are not tagged
with any milestone will not be taken into account.
