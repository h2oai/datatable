/**
  * "Logical" type of a data column.
  *
  * Logical type is supposed to match the user's notion of a column
  * type. For example logical "LType::INT" type corresponds to the
  * mathematical set of integers, and thus reflects the usual notion
  * of what the "integer" *is*.
  *
  * Each logical type has multiple underlying "storage" types, that
  * describe how the type is actually stored in memory. For example,
  * LType::INT can be stored as an 8-, 16-, 32- or a 64-bit integer.
  * All "storage" types within a single logical type should be freely
  * interchangeable: operators or functions that accept certain
  * logical type should be able to work with any its storage subtype.
  *
  * Different logical types may or may not be interchangeable,
  * depending on the use case. For example, most binary operators
  * would promote boolean -> integer -> real; however some operators
  * / functions may not. For example, bit shift operators require
  * integer (or boolean) arguments.
  *
  *
  * LType::MU
  *     type for a column that has unknown type. Such column may
  *     contain only NA values.
  *
  * LType::BOOL
  *     column for storing boolean (0/1) values. Right now we only
  *     allow to store booleans as 1-byte signed chars. In most
  *     arithmetic expressions booleans are automatically promoted
  *     to integers (or reals) if needed.
  *
  * LType::INT
  *     integer values, equivalent of ℤ in mathematics. We support
  *     multiple storage sizes for integers: from 8 bits to 64 bits,
  *     but do not allow arbitrary-length integers. In most
  *     expressions integers will be automatically promoted to reals
  *     if needed.
  *
  * LType::REAL
  *     real values, equivalent of ℝ in mathematics. We store these
  *     in either fixed- or floating-point formats.
  *
  * LType::STRING
  *     all strings are encoded in UTF-8. We allow either variable-
  *     width strings or fixed-width.
  *
  * LType::DATETIME
  * LType::DURATION
  *
  * LType::OBJECT
  *     column for storing all other values of arbitrary (possibly
  *     heterogeneous) types. Each element is a `PyObject*`. Missing
  *     values are `Py_None`s.
