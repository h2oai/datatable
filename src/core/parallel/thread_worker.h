/**
 * This class handles putting to sleep/awaking of workers in a thread pool.
 * A single instance of this class exists in `thread_pool`.
 *
 * Initially all workers in a thread pool are in the "idle" state, running the
 * sleep task returned by this scheduler. This sleep task is `tsleep[0]`, and
 * it contains a mutex, and a condition variable. In this state the workers are
 * simply waiting, though they may occasionally be woken by the operating system
 * to check whether `tsleep[0].next_scheduler` became non-null.
 *
 * More precisely, a thread is considered to be asleep if its scheduler is this
 * class, and if the thread already requested a sleep task from this scheduler
 * and started executing that sleep task.
 *
 * When master thread calls `awaken` (and only the master thread is allowed to
 * do so), we do the following:
 *   - lock `tsleep[0].mutex` (at this point no thread can awaken, even
 *     spuriously, because they would need to acquire lock on the same mutex as
 *     they wake up);
 *   - set `tsleep[0].next_scheduler` to the job that needs to be executed;
 *   - set `tsleep[1].next_scheduler` to nullptr;
 *   - change `index` from 0 to 1;
 *   - unlock the mutex and notify all threads waiting on
 *     `tsleep[0].wakeup_all_threads_cv`.
 *
 * As the threads awaken, they check their task's `next_scheduler` property, see
 * that it is now not-null, they will switch to that scheduler and finish their
 * current sleep task. Note that it may take some time for OS to notify and
 * awaken all the threads; some threads may already finish their new task by the
 * time the last thread in the team gets up.
 *
 * When a thread's queue is exhausted and there are no more tasks to do, that
 * worker receives a `nullptr` from `get_next_task()`. At this moment the
 * worker switches back to `idle_job`, and requests a task. The
 * thread sleep scheduler will now return `tsleep[1]`, which has its own mutex
 * and a condition variable, and its `.next_scheduler` is null, indicating the
 * sleeping state. This will allow the thread to go safely to sleep, while other
 * threads might still be waking up from the initial sleep.
 *
 * The master thread that called `awaken(job)` will then call `job.join()`,
 * and it is the responsibility of thread_scheduler `job` to wait until all
 * threads have finished execution and were put back to sleep. Thus, the master
 * thread ensures that all threads are sleeping again before the next call to
 * `awaken`.
