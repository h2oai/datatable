  * Pool of threads, capable of executing a given workload in
  * parallel.
  *
  * The pool contains a certain number of `ThreadWorker`s, each
  * running on its own thread, except for the 0th worker which
  * represents the main thread and should be invoked manually. The
  * number of workers can be adjusted up or down using `resize()`.
  *
  * Normally, the thread pool is in the "sleeping" state. This means
  * all workers are idling, executing sleep tasks from the `Job_Idle`
  * (see documentation of this class in "ThreadWorker.h").
  *
  * However, once a user requests `execute_job()`, the threads are
  * awakened and use the supplied scheduler to perform the job. The
  * method `execute_job()` is blocking, and will return only after
  * the job is completely finished and the thread pool has been put
  * back to sleep.
