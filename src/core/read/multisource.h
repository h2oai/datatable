/**
  * This class encapsulates various input sources for ?read family
  * of functions.
  *
  * Consider that the input for fread may come in a number of
  * different shapes: a string, a file, a list of files, a glob
  * pattern, a URL, an archive, a multi-sheet XLS file, etc. This
  * class encapsulates all that variety under a single interface.
  *
  * Internally, this class contains a vector of `Source_*` objects,
  * each representing an input source that produces a single Frame
  * object in the output.
  *
  * Occasionally, there could be inputs that look as single sources,
  * while in fact containing several Frames inside. Examples are:
  * CSV files that are concatenation of tables with different number
  * of columns; Excel files where a single sheet contains several
  * disjoint tables; etc. Normally, in such cases the Source_* object
  * returns a single Frame and emits a warning about additional
  * Frames being present. However, if a special input option is
  * given, then we would want all those frames to be returned. In
  * such a case, the input source must return a single frame, and
  * then set an internal attribute indicating that more frames are
  * pending. This class will then query that attribute, and collect
  * all frames, one at a time.
