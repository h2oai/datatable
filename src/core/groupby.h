/**
  * Groupby object describes how a Frame can be split into groups.
  *
  * This object does not carry a reference to the Frame it is
  * splitting, in fact the same Groupby can be applied to multiple
  * Frames provided they have the same number of rows. This
  * possibility is actually used in EvalContext, where a single
  * Groupby may operate on multiple joined frames.
  *
  * The object contains fields `ngroups_` (which could be 0 or more),
  * and `offsets_`, which is an array of cumulative offsets of each
  * subsequent group. The `offsets_` array has `ngroups_ + 1` elements
  * and the first offset is always 0. The last offset (available via
  * `.last_offset()`) is equal to the number of rows that in a Frame
  * that this Groupby applies to.
  *
  * If the target Frame has 0 rows, then it can be described as either
  * 0 groups, or as 1 group of size 0. In all other cases offsets are
  * strictly increasing: groups of size 0 are not allowed.
  *
  * An empty Groupby can be created using the default constructor:
  * `Groupby()`. Unlike any "normal" Groupby, in this case the
  * `offsets_` array will be empty. Use `operator bool()` to test
  * whether a Groupby object is empty or not.
