# datatable

This is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular data structures
(aka data frames). It is close in spirit to [pandas] or [SFrame]; however we
put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the
package is closely related to R's [data.table] and attempts to mimic its core
algorithms and API.


Currently `datatable` is in the Alpha stage and is undergoing active
development. The API may be unstable; some of the core features are incomplete
and/or missing.


Python 3.5+ is required. There are no plans to support any earlier Python
versions.
