/**
 * This is a main class used to evaluate the expression `DT[i, j, ...]`. This
 * class is essentially a "work-in-progress Frame", hence the name. It is not
 * a real frame, however, in the sense that it may be misshapen, or violate
 * other Frame constraints at some point in its lifetime.
 *
 * Initially, a workframe is created using the DataTable* object `DT` which is
 * at the root of the expression `DT[i, j, ...]`.
 *
 * Later, `join_node`(s) may append additional DataTable* objects, with all
 * `RowIndex`es specifying how they merge together.
 *
 * The `by_node` will attach a `Groupby` object. The Groupby will specify how
 * the rows are split into groups, and it applies to all `DataTable*`s in the
 * workframe. The shape of the Groupby must be compatible with all current
 * `RowIndex`es.
 *
 * An `i_node` applies a new row filter to all Frames in the workframe. If
 * there is a non-empty Groupby, the `i_node` must apply within each group, and
 * then update the Groupby to account for the new configuration of the rows.
