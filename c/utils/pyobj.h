   *
   * The `as_cstring` method will return pointer to the `const char*` buffer
   * containing the string. The returned pointer will not be owned by the
   * caller, and its lifetime is tied to the lifetime of the current PyObj.
   * This method can be called only once on the PyObj. It is more efficient than
   * the first one (avoids extra copy), but less safe (the user must handle the
   * lifetime carefully). If the object is Py_None, a null pointer is returned.
   *
   * The `as_ccstring` method is similar to `as_cstring`, however the returned
   * pointer will be owned by the caller, and the caller is responsible for its
   * deallocation (via delete[]). This method is also less efficient than
   * `as_cstring`, since it allocates and copies the string data into a new
   * character buffer. If the object is Py_None, a null pointer is returned.
