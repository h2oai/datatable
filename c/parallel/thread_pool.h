/**
 * Pool of threads, capable of executing a given work load in parallel.
 *
 * The pool contains a certain number of `thread_worker`s, each running on its
 * own thread. The number of workers can be adjusted up or down using method
 * `set_number_of_threads()`.
 *
 * Normally, the thread pool is in the "sleeping" state. This means all workers
 * are idling, consuming sleep tasks from the `worker_controller`
 * (see documentation of `worker_controller` in "thread_worker.h").
 *
 * However, once a user requests `execute_job()`, the threads are awaken and
 * use the supplied scheduler to perform the job. The method `execute_job()` is
 * blocking, and will return only after the job is completely finished and the
 * thread pool has been put back to sleep.
 *
 * The main thread of execution (which runs `execute_job()` and is connected to
 * Python) does not perform any tasks. Instead, it only performs high-level
 * maintenance: progress reporting, message logs, exception handling, checking
 * for user interrupts, etc.
 *
