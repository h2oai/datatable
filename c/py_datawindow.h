/**
 * This object facilitates access to a `DataTable`s data from Python. The idea
 * is that a datatable may be huge, possibly containing gigabytes of data. At
 * the same time, exposing any primitive to a Python runtime requires wrapping
 * that primitive into a `PyObject`, which adds a significant amount of
 * overhead (both in terms of memory and CPU).
 *
 * `DataWindow` objects come to the rescue: they take small rectangular
 * subsections of a datatable's data, and represent them as Python objects.
 * Such limited amount of data is usually sufficient from users' perspective
 * since they are able to view only a limited amount of data in their viewport
 * anyways.
