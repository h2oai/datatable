//     .ptr -- the `postprocessBuffer` stores here the total amount of string

//         thread that needs to realloc the underlying buffer. Without the lock,

//         `.numuses` variable: when positive it shows the number of threads
//         that are currently writing to the same buffer. However when this
//         variable is negative, it means the buffer is being realloced, and no
//         other threads is allowed to initiate a memcopy.

/**
 * This callback is invoked by `freadMain` after the initial pre-scan of the

 * detected column names are; and secondly what is the expected type of each
 * column. The upstream code then has an opportunity to upcast the column types
 * if requested by the user, or mark some columns as skipped.
 *
 * @param types
 *    type codes of each column in the CSV file. Possible type codes are
 *    described by the `colType` enum. The function may modify this array
 *    setting some types to 0 (CT_DROP), or upcasting the types. Downcasting is
 *    not allowed and will trigger an error from `freadMain` later on.
 *
 * @param colNames
 *    array of `lenOff` structures (offsets are relative to the `anchor`)
 *    describing the column names. If the CSV file had no header row, then this
 *    array will be filled with 0s.
 *
 * @param anchor
 *    pointer to a string buffer (usually somewhere inside the memory-mapped
 *    file) within which the column names are located, as described by the
 *    `colNames` array.
 *
 * @param ncol
 *    total number of columns. This is the length of arrays `types` and
 *    `colNames`.
 *
 * @return
 *    this function may return `false` to request that fread abort reading

 * then this function will be called second time with updated `types` array.
 * Then this function's responsibility is to update the allocation of those
 * columns properly.
 *
 * @param types
 *     array of type codes for each column. Same as in the `userOverride`
 *     function.
 *
 * @param sizes
 *    the size (in bytes) of each column within the buffer(s) that will be

 *    later use. It exists mostly for convenience, since the size of each

 * @param ncols
 *    number of columns in the CSV file. This is the size of arrays `types` and
 *    `sizes`.
 *
 * @param ndrop
 *    count of columns with type CT_DROP. This parameter is provided for
 *    convenience, since it can always be computed from `types`. The resulting
 *    datatable will have `ncols - ndrop` columns.
 *
 * @param nrows
 *    the number of rows to allocate for the datatable. This number of rows is
 *    estimated during the initial pre-scan, and then adjusted upwards to
 *    account for possible variation. It is very unlikely that this number
 *    underestimates the final row count.
