/**
 * type
 *     The type of the RowMapping: either array or a slice. Two kinds of arrays
 *     are supported: one with 32-bit indices and having no more than 2**31-1
 *     elements, and the other with 64-bit indices and having up to 2**63-1
 *     items.
 *
 * length
 *     Total number of elements in the RowMapping (corresponds to `nrows` in
 *     the datatable). This length must be nonnegative and cannot exceed
 *     2**63-1.
 *
 * min, max
 *     The smallest / largest elements in the current RowMapping. If the length
 *     of the rowmapping is 0, then both min and max will be 0.
 *
 * ind32
 *     The array of (32-bit) indices comprising the RowMapping. The number of
 *     elements in this array is `length`. Available if `type == RM_ARR32`.
 *
 * ind64
 *     The array of (64-bit) indices comprising the RowMapping. The number of
 *     elements in this array is `length`. Available if `type == RM_ARR64`.
 *
 * slice.start
 * slice.step
 *     RowMapping specified as a slice (available if `type == RM_SLICE`). The
 *     indices in this RowMapping are:
 *         start, start + step, start + 2*step, ..., start + (length - 1)*step
 *     The `start` is a nonnegative number, while `step` may be positive,
 *     negative or zero (however `start + (length - 1)*step` must be nonnegative
 *     and being able to fit inside `int64_t`). The variable `start` is declared
 *     as `int64_t` because if it was `size_t` then it wouldn't be possible to
 *     do simple addition `start + step`.
