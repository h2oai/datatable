Do you have a general question about datatable functionality?
The best place to ask is StackOverflow. Be sure to tag your question
with `[python] + [py-datatable]` tags, plus any other that you see fit.

Questions posted on StackOverflow will be seen by more people,
answered faster, and will be findable by others with a similar
problem. Plus, you'll earn reputation points!

However, if your question is directed specifically to the datatable
developers, or does not fit into the SO format (for example, if it is
primarily opinion-based), then visit our
[Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/h2oai/datatable) and ask there.
