about: Suggest an idea for new datatable functionality

---

- Is there something datatable can't do just yet, but you think it'd be nice if it did?
  Tell us what it is.

- Is it related to some problem you're trying to solve?
  We might be able to suggest a workaround until your feature is implemented.

- What do you think the API for your feature should be?
  Should this be a function / method / special syntax / etc? If this is a function, what arguments
  it might take, and what their types should be. Provide as much or as little details as you like.

- Tag your request with {improve} label.
  Thanks for contributing, we appreciate your input!
