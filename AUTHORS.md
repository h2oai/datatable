The `datatable` is an open-source Python library for manipulation of tabular
data. It is primarily developed at H2O.ai, with the support of broader
community.

The `datatable` is a younger sibling of [R data.table][https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki] project, and attempts
to mimic the core of its API. The R data.table project is primarily developed by
[Matt Dowle][], who is its main author, and who blessed the development of
Python `datatable` by allowing the use of name "data table" and providing the
initial advice and direction.
