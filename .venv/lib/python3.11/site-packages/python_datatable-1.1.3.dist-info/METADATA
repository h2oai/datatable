This is an automate Fork of datatable.
Because there is no automated build / publish pipeline for the datatable package, and it is not optimal to always install from GitHub.
Fork-URL: https://github.com/semmjon/datatable.git

This is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular data structures
(aka data frames). It is close in spirit to [pandas][] or [SFrame][]; however we
put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the name suggests, the
package is closely related to R's [data.table][] and attempts to mimic its core
algorithms and API.

Requirements: Python 3.6+ (64 bit) and pip 20.3+.


## Project goals

`datatable` started in 2017 as a toolkit for performing big data (up to 100GB)
operations on a single-node machine, at the maximum speed possible. Such
requirements are dictated by modern machine-learning applications, which need
to process large volumes of data and generate many features in order to
achieve the best model accuracy. The first user of `datatable` was
[Driverless.ai][].

The set of features that we want to implement with `datatable` is at least
the following:

* Column-oriented data storage.

* Native-C implementation for all datatypes, including strings. Packages such
  as pandas and numpy already do that for numeric columns, but not for
  strings.

* Support for date-time and categorical types. Object type is also supported,
  but promotion into object discouraged.

* All types should support null values, with as little overhead as possible.

* Data should be stored on disk in the same format as in memory. This will
  allow us to memory-map data on disk and work on out-of-memory datasets
  transparently.

* Work with memory-mapped datasets to avoid loading into memory more data than
  necessary for each particular operation.

* Fast data reading from CSV and other formats.

* Multi-threaded data processing: time-consuming operations should attempt to
  utilize all cores for maximum efficiency.

* Efficient algorithms for sorting/grouping/joining.

* Expressive query syntax (similar to [data.table][]).

* Minimal amount of data copying, copy-on-write semantics for shared data.

* Use "rowindex" views in filtering/sorting/grouping/joining operators to
  avoid unnecessary data copying.

* Interoperability with pandas / numpy / pyarrow / pure python: the users
  should have the ability to convert to another data-processing framework
  with ease.


## Installation

On macOS, Linux and Windows systems installing datatable is as easy as
```sh
pip install datatable
```

On all other platforms a source distribution will be needed. For more
information see [Build instructions](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
